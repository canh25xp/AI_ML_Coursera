00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.960
Welcome to this video on Clustering, Dimension Reduction, and Feature Engineering.

2
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.620
After watching this video, you will be able to explain clustering, dimension reduction,

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.079
and feature engineering and how these techniques work together to enhance model performance.

4
00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.239
You will also learn about dimension reduction and its role in simplifying data structures

5
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.559
and improving outcomes.

6
00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.520
Additionally, you'll analyze the application of dimension reduction in face recognition

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.919
and explore how clustering can facilitate feature selection.

8
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:39.080
Clustering, dimension reduction, and feature engineering are complementary techniques in

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.060
machine learning and data science.

10
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.319
They work well together to improve model performance, quality, and interpretability.

11
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.720
Clustering helps with feature selection and creation while supporting dimension reduction

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.240
to enhance computational efficiency and scalability.

13
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.480
Dimension reduction simplifies the visualization of high-dimensional clustering,

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.360
aiding feature engineering and improving model quality.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.040
It also reduces the number of features required for a data model.

16
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.799
Dimension reduction is commonly used as a pre-processing step for clustering,

17
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.699
simplifying data structure and improving outcomes.

18
00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:13.319
High-dimensional data poses challenges for distance-based clustering algorithms like

19
00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.580
k-means and DBSCAN.

20
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.440
As dimensionality increases, volume expands rapidly, causing data points to become sparse

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.760
and less similar.

22
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.479
This leads to smaller clusters requiring more data to fill gaps.

23
00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.360
Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP are employed to reduce dimensions

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.959
before applying clustering algorithms, enhancing efficiency.

25
00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.959
This example uses eigenfaces as input features for supervised face recognition.

26
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.780
PCA is performed on an unlabeled face dataset,

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.680
extracting the top 150 eigenfaces from a total of 966 faces.

28
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.120
These 150 eigenfaces form an orthonormal basis for the feature space defined by the face dataset.

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
The input data is then projected onto this eigenface basis,

30
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.559
and an SMV is trained to predict faces.

31
00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.940
Dimensionality reduction techniques preserve the key features for identifying faces while

32
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.160
minimizing computational load.

33
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.600
The facial recognition task accurately predicts 12 faces, as illustrated in this image.

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.600
This chart illustrates the quantitative evaluation of the model's quality on the dataset.

35
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.000
Clustering results cannot be visualized directly when working with feature spaces beyond three dimensions.

36
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.320
However, advanced dimension reduction techniques can project these clustering outcomes into

37
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.039
two or three dimensions, significantly improving visual interpretation.

38
00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:36.160
Methods such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP allow for meaningful projections of higher-dimensional

39
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.740
clusters into two or three dimensions.

40
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.720
This enables the creation of scatter plots that facilitate the visualization of clustering quality.

41
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.600
Reducing the dimensionality of data often enhances cluster interoperability, making

42
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.119
it easier to identify key patterns or relationships that may be obscured in higher dimensions.

43
00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.419
Clustering techniques can be applied to data observations and features.

44
00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.000
By clustering similar or correlated features,

45
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.039
you can identify sets that provide redundant information.

46
00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.880
This enables feature selection by choosing a representative feature from each cluster,

47
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.600
reducing the total number of features while preserving valuable information.

48
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
Clustering can help with feature engineering decisions.

49
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.699
For instance, if clusters indicate distinct subgroups in data, specific interactions between

50
00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.720
features or certain transformations could benefit predictive modeling.

51
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
Here is a simple simulation using a clustering method like k-means to cluster features.

52
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.800
Each of the five features plotted here was generated with a random normal distribution

53
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.639
with three different mean values, 1, 5, and 10, and variances of 1, except for feature

54
00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.279
number 4, which has a variance of 2.

55
00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.199
As you can see visually, features 1 through 3 are statistically very similar, with the

56
00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.919
same mean and variance.

57
00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.839
Features 4 and 5 stand out.

58
00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:50.240
Indeed, running k-means on the features, not the data values, with k equals 3 correctly,

59
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.720
clustering the features.

60
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.119
Cluster 1 contains redundant features, so if you were to do any modeling with this dataset,

61
00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.059
you would want to select only one of them.

62
00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.919
This is an example of implementing feature selection, part of feature engineering.

63
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.479
You can also view it as dimension reduction.

64
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:09.339
In this video, you learned to explain clustering, dimension reduction, and feature engineering

65
00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:14.699
and how they work well together to improve model performance, quality, and interpretability.

66
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.700
Explain dimension reduction and how it is used as a preprocessing step for clustering,

67
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.920
simplifying data structure, and improving outcomes.

68
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.420
Analyze how dimension reduction is used for face recognition with eigenfaces as input features.

69
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.339
Analyze how clustering can be used for feature selection to identify sets that provide redundant information.

70
00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.140
And finally, analyze feature selection using k-means to cluster features.
