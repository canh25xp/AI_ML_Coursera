00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.359
Congratulations on completing the course.

2
00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.920
Now that you have explored the theoretical concepts and practical applications of machine

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.479
learning, you will find plenty of opportunities to continue learning and applying your skills.

4
00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:21.159
Now let's review some key aspects of what you learned throughout the course.

5
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:26.040
Machine learning, ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence, or AI, that involves using data

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.159
and algorithms to allow computers to imitate how humans learn and make decisions, gradually

7
00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.639
improving their accuracy.

8
00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:35.479
ML has many applications in the modern world.

9
00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.159
In healthcare, doctors use machine learning to prescribe the correct medicine to their

10
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.159
patients.

11
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.240
Bankers use machine learning to decide whether to approve or reject a loan application.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.400
E-commerce businesses use machine learning to generate customer recommendations.

13
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.919
Machine learning models learn using supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning methods.

14
00:00:55.919 --> 00:01:00.080
Selecting a machine learning technique depends on several factors, such as the problem you're

15
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.239
trying to solve, the type of data you have, the available resources, and the desired outcome.

16
00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.160
Machine learning tools provide functionalities for machine learning pipelines, which include

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.800
modules for data preprocessing and building, evaluating, optimizing, and implementing machine

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.160
learning models.

19
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
These tools use algorithms to simplify complex tasks, such as handling big data, conducting

20
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.080
statistical analyses, and making predictions.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.459
Regression is a type of supervised learning model.

22
00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.639
It models a relationship between a continuous target variable and explanatory features.

23
00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:37.959
Simple regression is when a single independent variable estimates a dependent variable.

24
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.699
This regression can be linear or nonlinear.

25
00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:46.199
When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple regression.

26
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.199
Multiple linear regression is an extension of the simple linear regression model.

27
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:54.360
It uses two or more independent variables to estimate a dependent variable.

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.239
In logistical regression training, you look for the best parameters that map the input

29
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.279
features to the target outcomes.

30
00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:04.279
The objective is to predict classes with minimal error.

31
00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:09.039
Classification is a supervised machine learning, or ML, method that uses fully trained models

32
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.000
to predict labels on new data.

33
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.500
The labels in classification form a categorical variable with discrete values.

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.039
Classification has several applications in a wide variety of industries.

35
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.520
It can be used to build applications for email filtering, speech-to-text, handwriting

36
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.000
recognition, biometric identification, document classification, and much more.

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.259
K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a supervised machine learning algorithm that takes a group

38
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.720
of labeled data points and then uses them to learn to label other data points.

39
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.559
KNN is used for both classification and regression.

40
00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:48.360
Support Vector Machines, or SVM, is a supervised learning technique for building classification

41
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.960
and regression models.

42
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.779
It maps each data instance as a point in multidimensional space, where the input features

43
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.880
are represented as a value for a specific coordinate.

44
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.360
SVM is good for machine learning problems, such as speech recognition, anomaly detection,

45
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.800
and noise filtering.

46
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.639
A decision tree is an algorithm for classifying data points.

47
00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.720
In a decision tree, each internal node corresponds to a test.

48
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.880
Each branch corresponds to the result of the test, and each terminal, or leaf node, assigns

49
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.919
its data to a class.

50
00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.679
Regression trees are built by considering the features of a data set, one by one.

51
00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:29.360
A regression tree is analogous to a decision tree that predicts continuous values rather

52
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.960
than discrete classes.

53
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.399
The distinguishing feature between classification and regression is the characteristic of the

54
00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.960
target, or labeled data.

55
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.720
Regression trees are created by recursively splitting the data set into subsets to maximize

56
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.039
information gained from data splitting.

57
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.679
This process generates a tree-like structure and minimizes the randomness of the classes

58
00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.600
assigned to the split nodes.

59
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.320
Clustering, dimension reduction, and feature engineering are complementary techniques in

60
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.399
machine learning and data science.

61
00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.360
They work well together to improve model performance, quality, and interpretability.

62
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.119
Clustering automatically groups data points into clusters based on similarities.

63
00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:13.440
It can be applied in various scenarios, such as identifying music genres, segmenting user

64
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.480
groups, or analyzing market segments.

65
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.040
Dimension reduction simplifies the visualization of high-dimensional clustering, aiding feature

66
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.720
engineering and improving model quality.

67
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.140
It also reduces the number of features required for a data model.

68
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.200
Dimensionality reduction algorithms reduce the number of data set features without sacrificing

69
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.040
critical data set information.

70
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.119
High-dimensional data is often very difficult to analyze and visualize.

71
00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:44.279
Dimensionality reduction algorithms simplify the data set for machine learning models.

72
00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.279
Supervised learning evaluation establishes how well a machine learning model can predict

73
00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.119
the outcome for unseen data.

74
00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.720
It is essential for understanding model effectiveness and involves comparing model predictions to

75
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.559
ground-truth labels.

76
00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.640
Common metrics for evaluating classification models include accuracy, confusion matrix,

77
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.079
precision, and recall.

78
00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.760
Regression models are not foolproof.

79
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.119
They often make prediction errors.

80
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:12.679
Evaluating a regression model involves determining how accurately the model can predict continuous

81
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.760
numerical values, such as exam grades.

82
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.559
Unsupervised techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, aim to discover

83
00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.239
hidden patterns and structures in data.

84
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.839
Therefore, evaluation methods assess the quality of these patterns and how effectively the

85
00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.000
model groups similar data points.

86
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600
Model validation is a method to optimize your ML model without jeopardizing its ability

87
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.899
to predict well on unseen data.

88
00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:42.600
It helps you prevent overfitting when selecting the best model configuration by tuning hyperparameters

89
00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:47.679
Checking performance on the test data before you are done optimizing your model is called

90
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:51.399
data snooping, a form of data leakage.

91
00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:55.320
Validation means tuning your model on the training data but only testing it on unseen

92
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.079
test data once you are satisfied that it is well trained.

93
00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.239
There is no snooping involved.

94
00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:04.019
Now that you've reviewed some of the fundamental ideas presented in this course, remember that

95
00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:06.559
each module has a summary and a glossary.

96
00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.619
You can use them to quickly reference much of what you have learned.

97
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.440
To strengthen your learning from this course, actively participate in and complete the practice

98
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.820
assessment at the end of each lesson and the graded assessment at the end of each module

99
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.540
offered across the course.

100
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.619
The course contains multiple hands-on labs and a final project to help you gain practical

101
00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.019
exposure to the tools and technologies you learned.

102
00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:31.220
