00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:08.580
Welcome to Machine Learning Model Lifecycle.

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.500
After watching this video, you will be able
to:

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.657
List the processes within the lifecycle of
a Machine Learning product.

4
00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:17.390
Hello!

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.050
My name is Isioma.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.829
I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at a
leading company.

7
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.259
We sell machine learning solutions that enhance
the user experience for people shopping for

8
00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.579
beauty products.

9
00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:33.600
Today, I will walk you through a Machine Learning
project from start to finish.

10
00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:39.070
Let’s begin by looking at the processes
in the Lifecycle of a Machine Learning Model.

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.910
First, define the problem or state the situation.

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.820
Next, move to data collection,

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820
then to data preparation,

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.749
then to model development and evaluation,
and finally

15
00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.030
to model deployment.

16
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.030
In reality, the model lifecycle is iterative,
which means that we tend to go back and forth

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.019
between these processes.

18
00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.140
For example, if you find some problems with
your models that are deployed in production,

19
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.979
you may need to go back to data collection,
or even the problem definition step, and then

20
00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.070
re-iterate the subsequent processes.

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.000
Data collection and preparation is called
the Extract, Transform, and Load, or ETL process.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.270
The ETL process involves collecting data from
various sources,

23
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.680
then cleaning, transforming, and storing it
into a new single place.

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.320
The data is then accessible to the machine
learning engineer, allowing them to perform

25
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.630
tasks like building a machine learning model.

26
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.820
In this video, you learned that:

27
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.670
The processes involved in a Machine Learning
Model Lifecycle are Problem Definition, Data

28
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.367
Collection, Data Preparation, Model Development
and Evaluation, and Model Deployment.
