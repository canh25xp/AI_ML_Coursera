In this module, you'll explore unsupervised learning, a machine-learning approach that doesn't require labeled data. Instead of using correct answers, these algorithms identify patterns in data based on similarity. These patterns form clusters in an N-dimensional feature space, where data points that are close together can be considered clusters. Clusters may have a hierarchical structure, similar to natural systems such as galaxies or biological taxonomies. You'll learn about clustering algorithms and how unsupervised learning can reduce features for other modeling tasks, using Python to implement various clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
