In this module, you will learn how to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning models using various metrics, depending on whether you are building classification or regression models. You will explore hyperparameter tuning techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure an unbiased model evaluation. Additionally, you will learn about regularization techniques for linear regression to mitigate overfitting caused by noise and outliers. Finally, you will gain hands-on experience in building, fine-tuning, and evaluating models using these techniques.
