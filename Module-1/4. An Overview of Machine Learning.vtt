00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.819
Welcome to Machine Learning Techniques and Applications.

2
00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.760
After watching this video, you will be able to explain machine learning, identify machine

3
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.299
learning techniques, and describe applications of machine learning.

4
00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:26.860
Artificial intelligence, or AI, makes computers appear intelligent by simulating the cognitive

5
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.260
abilities of humans.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.260
AI is a general field with a broad scope.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.659
It comprises computer vision, natural language processing, generative AI, machine learning,

8
00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.860
and deep learning.

9
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
Machine learning, or ML, is the subset of AI that uses algorithms and requires feature

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.139
engineering by practitioners.

11
00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:51.180
Deep learning distinguishes itself from traditional machine learning by using many-layered neural

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.220
networks that automatically extract features from highly complex, unstructured big data.

13
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.180
Machine learning teaches computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions

14
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
without receiving any explicit instructions from a human being.

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.459
ML algorithms use computational methods to learn information directly from data without

16
00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.260
depending on any fixed algorithm.

17
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.540
Machine learning models differ in how they learn.

18
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.300
For example, supervised learning models train on labeled data to learn how to make inferences

19
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.379
on new data, enabling them to predict otherwise unknown labels.

20
00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:31.660
Unsupervised learning works without labels by finding patterns in data.

21
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.500
Semi-supervised learning trains on a relatively small subset of data that is already labeled,

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.739
and iteratively retrains itself by adding new labels that it generates with reasonably

23
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.459
high confidence.

24
00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.459
Reinforcement learning simulates an artificially intelligent agent interacting with its environment

25
00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.459
and learns how to make decisions based on feedback from its environment.

26
00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.139
Selecting a machine learning technique depends on several factors, such as the problem you're

27
00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:02.180
trying to solve, the type of data you have, the available resources, and the desired outcome.

28
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.860
A classification technique is used to predict the class or category of a case, such as whether

29
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.199
a cell is benign or malignant or whether a customer will churn.

30
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.539
The regression-slash-estimation technique is used to predict continuous values, such

31
00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:20.860
as the price of a house based on its characteristics or the CO2 emissions from a car's engine.

32
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.800
Clustering groups of similar cases, for example, can find similar patients or can be used for

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.559
customer segmentation in the banking field.

34
00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.699
The association technique is used to find items or events that often co-occur, such

35
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:39.160
as grocery items usually bought together by a particular customer or market segment.

36
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.880
Anomaly detection is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases.

37
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.880
For example, it's used for credit card fraud detection.

38
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.320
Sequence mining is used to predict the next event.

39
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.679
For instance, the clickstream analytics in websites.

40
00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:57.440
Classification reduction is used to reduce data size,
particularly the number of features needed.

41
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.320
And finally, recommendation systems.

42
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.000
This associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.119
and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.

44
00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.240
We'll cover some of these techniques in the next videos.

45
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.000
To train your machine learning model on supervised data,

46
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.560
you can select between the classification or regression technique.

47
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360
Classification categorizes input data into one of several predefined categories or classes,

48
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.639
and then makes predictions about the class membership of new observations.

49
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.520
Regression is different from classification.

50
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.720
It does not make predictions about the class membership of new input data.

51
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.479
Regression predicts continuous numerical values from input data.

52
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.679
Clustering is one of many unsupervised machine learning techniques for data modeling.

53
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.100
It's used to group data points or objects that are somehow similar.

54
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.160
For example, in this chart, we use a clustering algorithm to represent data points in green,

55
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
red, and blue color.

56
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.520
The uncategorized data points represented in black color are considered noise.

57
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.000
Let's look at some applications of machine learning now.

58
00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.759
This is a human cell sample extracted from a patient.

59
00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.360
It has some unique characteristics.

60
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.800
For example, its clump thickness is 6, its uniformity of cell size is 1, its marginal

61
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.399
adhesion is 1, and so on.

62
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:19.000
An interesting question we can ask by looking at this chart is,
is this a benign or malignant cell?

63
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Compared to a benign cell, a malignant cell invades its surrounding tissue

64
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.799
and spreads around the body.

65
00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:28.100
Identifying the cell type early can be the key to the patient's survival.

66
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.760
One could easily presume that only a doctor with years of experience could identify the

67
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.600
cell and confirm if the patient is developing a cancer or not.

68
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.279
Imagine you've obtained a dataset containing characteristics of thousands of human cell

69
00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:44.799
samples extracted from patients believed to be at risk of developing cancer.

70
00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:48.859
Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly

71
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.299
between benign and malignant samples.

72
00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:55.619
You can use the values of these cell characteristics in samples from other patients to indicate

73
00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.660
whether a new sample might be benign or malignant.

74
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.100
You should clean your data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model,

75
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.859
and train your model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.

76
00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:11.799
Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict

77
00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.059
your new or unknown cell with a rather high accuracy.

78
00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.839
This is the power of machine learning.

79
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.600
Machine learning impacts society in a very meaningful way.

80
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.239
How do Amazon and Netflix recommend content and products for their users?

81
00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.959
They use machine learning.

82
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.359
This is similar to how your friends might recommend a television show to you based on

83
00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:32.519
their knowledge of the types of shows you like to watch.

84
00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.399
How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application?

85
00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.679
They use machine learning to predict each applicant's default probability and then

86
00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:44.859
augment their decision to approve or deny the loan application based on that probability.

87
00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:48.420
How do telecommunication companies find how many of their customers will churn?

88
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.579
They use demographic data to segment their customers and predict whether a customer will

89
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:55.779
unsubscribe within the next month.

90
00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.179
Let's use computer vision as an example of how machine learning works.

91
00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:03.540
Assume you have a large collection of images of cats and dogs.

92
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.239
You want to develop a software application to differentiate cats from dogs.

93
00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:11.820
The first thing you must do here is interpret the images as a progression of features.

94
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.859
For example, does the image show the animal's eyes?

95
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:16.540
If so, what is their size?

96
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.619
Does it have ears?

97
00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:18.660
What about a tail?

98
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.660
How many legs?

99
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.540
Does it have wings?

100
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.339
For machine learning, we had to painstakingly create rules to get computers to appear intelligent

101
00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.320
and detect the animals, but it was a failure.

102
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.839
It needed a lot of rules, was too dependent on the current dataset, and therefore unable

103
00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:38.079
to characterize unseen cases.

104
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.359
Machine learning algorithms for computer vision have evolved to be able to identify

105
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.739
dogs and cats in images.

106
00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:47.679
With machine learning, you can build a model that learns a set of distinguishing animal

107
00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:53.239
features from known examples and use them to infer the animal type automatically.

108
00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:57.200
Although machine learning applications in the modern world are increasing, humans are

109
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.279
still in the mix.

110
00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:05.200
If an ML algorithm refuses a loan application, a banker wants to know why and initiates a follow-up.

111
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.000
There are many other applications of machine learning that we see every day, such as virtual

112
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.540
assistants like chatbots logging into our phones using face recognition or even playing

113
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.440
computer games like chess.

114
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.959
Each of these use different machine learning techniques and algorithms.

115
00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:26.160
In this video, you learned that machine learning is the subset of AI that uses algorithms and

116
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.200
requires feature engineering by practitioners.

117
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.519
Machine learning models learn using supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.

118
00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:42.000
Machine learning consists of several techniques, namely classification, regression, clustering,

119
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.279
association, anomaly detection, sequence mining, dimension reduction, and recommendation systems.

120
00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:52.880
Finally, you learned how machine learning is applied to predict diseases, analyze consumer

121
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.119
behavior, and recognize images.
